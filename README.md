# Securily
[Securily](https://securily.net) is a tool for cybersecurity awareness and education. Securily features pages for learning about cybersecurity, 
its importance, its history, and cybersecurity fields. Additionally, you can learn about the different kinds of cyber attacks such as 
malware, botnet, and phishing attacks and ways to help prevent them. To test your knowledge, there is a knowledge quiz as well as
two games, *malicious or benign?* and *Go Phish*, to make learning a little more fun. As a society, we have become reliant on 
cybersecurity. In doing so, we have to keep security up to match our reliance. Therefore, it is our responsivility as a society to 
bring awareness and education to keep those around us informed
