    <h2>What Is Cybersecurity?</h2>
    <p>
        Cyber security refers to the practices, processes, and technologies designed to protect systems, networks, and
        programs from digital attacks. These attacks can impact a variety of systems from business servers to your
        personal phone. This topic is often referred to as information technology security due to its domain
        encompassing anything connected to the Internet of Things or IoT(IoT link here).
    </p>

    <h2>A Brief History of Malware</h2>
    <p>
        Since the release of the first personal computer in 1974, the Altair, digital threats have existed in the
        background. The term many people are familiar with “bug” was coined when computer scientist Grace hopper found
        the cause of an early computer malfunction to be a moth trapped in one of the relays. The first digital
        self-replicating virus was released in 1971 just 3 years before the first personal computer became available.
        This virus was designed to duplicate itself many times over until the hard drive became full and the computer
        unusable. Since then the rate at which digital threats have been evolving has seen the same curve as the
        evolution of computers themselves. In 1998 there was a virus that infected over 60 million computers worldwide
        causing an estimated billion dollars in damage known as the CIH computer virus. In that same year the first DDoS
        attacks ever recorded were attacks on both the Mexican government and the Pentagon. These viruses were some of
        many whose only goal was to cause disruption and slow down networks.
    </p>

    </div>

        <p>
            These threats evolved into a new level of malware in the years that followed with MYDOOM (2004) and the
            introduction of Scamware (2005). These had more refined goals than their predecessors allowing them to do
            more than just attack systems. MYDOOM was Malware that was spread through spam mail. This started by
            stealing the email addresses of those who fell victim allowing it to spread to more people, then it created
            a back door on the users computer adding it to a network of controlled computers known as a
            botnet(insert link to the other page here). Scamware operated with a similar goal but was spread through
            pop-ups warning the user that their computer may be infected then prompting them to download something. This
            allowed them to install malicious code that could do a number of different attacks on the hosts computer.
        </p>
        <p>
            Not long after the aforementioned malware was released into the public new forms emerged which took cyber
            threats to the next level. These new forms of malware were designed to break into secure networks and steal
            entire databases of user data. The Zeus trojan in 2007 read the keys that users typed in order to steal
            credentials. It is most famous for stealing information from the department of transportation, but got into
            over 74,000 sites including BankofAmerica.com, NASA.gov, ABC.com, and Amazon.com. Other attempts used flaws
            in widely used software to exploit users. Conficker is an example of this which used a vulnerability in the
            Windows operating system to gain access to millions of computers since 2008 in its original release creating
            its own botnet from infected computers allowing it to carry out other malicious attacks such as data theft
            through phishing and brute force attacks as well as DDoS.
        </p>
        <p>
            While there are many defenses out there for the known forms of malware, each time a bug is stomped out
            another few come to take its place. Each of the new threats is more complicated than the last taking account
            to what worked and didn’t from its predecessors. As time progresses the rate at which new viruses and worms
            appears increases exponentially. Since 2010 there have been too many new viruses for them to be easily
            listed, but a few of them include Stuxnet, Flame, CryptoLocker, Gameover Zeus, BASHLITE, WannaCry, and more
            recently Thanatos and Titanium. The new tactic in recent digital attacks has been focused on the increased
            use of keys and certificates that grant the user access to secure files and information within certain
            servers. One of the most famous examples of this is the Snowden compromise of 2013 in which Edward Snowden
            used fabricated keys to increase his permissions level and access the sensitive information in the NSA
            allowing him to leak it. Of all the forms of security Keys and Certificates are among the least likely to be
            detected and are extremely slow to resolve.
        </p>
        <p>
            As we continue to become more and more dependent on information technology in every aspect of our lives we
            can only make guesses as to how these threats will adapt. The importance of cybersecurity comes into play
            when we try to stay one step ahead of any threat that may come our way. It will undoubtable continue to grow
            in importance as businesses and people need the protections and reassurances that come with further study in
            cybersecurity.
