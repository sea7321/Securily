                <h4 class="text-center">Certificates</h4>
                <p class="card-text">Cybersecurity certificates represent the completion of coursework related to a
                    specific educational program. The requirements for completion vary widely depending on the
                    certification, with some requiring multiple courses while others require only one. These courses can
                    take anywhere from a few weeks to a few years to complete depending on the complexity.</p>
                <p class="card-text">
                    The benefits of these courses may vary but in most cases they are worth a certain number of credit
                    hours which can often be applied to securing a degree or preparing for a certification. Additionally
                    , while most job postings do not require specific certificates, they can often be used as leverage
                    to fuel a promotion.

                <h4 class="text-center">Certifications</h4>
                <p class="card-text">Cybersecurity certifications assess the specific knowledge, skills, and abilities
                    of an IT professional, often updated to reflect more modern data. These certifications are issued by
                    independant organizations that work side-by-side with IT professionals in various different
                    IT-related fields. To earn the initial certification it is required that you pass one or more tests,
                    then in the time following there are Continuing Education Units that keep your certification active
                    and up-to-date.</p>
                <p class="card-text">
                    Among the most popular organizations that create and maintain these certifications are CompTIA,
                    Cisco, (ISC)<sup>2</sup>, ISACA, and GIAC. If you wanted to go through CompTIA for example then they
                    have a Cybersecurity Career Pathway with certifications chosen for any level of cybersecurity
                    professional. These range from a simple certification that shows a base knowledge of the subject,
                    granting an entry-way into many Cybersecurity jobs available today, to an advanced certification
                    that covers skills for people in the positions of engineers and architects. While the actual
                    certification exam only takes hours, the preparation required for these exams could take months
                    depending on the complexity. They usually cost around $300-500 for admittance to take the test, and
                    if successful then this opens the door to around half a million job postings that require
                    certifications like these.

                <h4 class="text-center">Degrees</h4>
                <p class="card-text">Cybersecurity degrees are offered by colleges and universities which encompasses
                    both undergraduate and graduate degree types. These are often obtained as a subdiscipline of a
                    larger computer science education, but it can be taken on its own. Keep in mind that there are many
                    cases in which cybersecurity jobs require a degree, but without the need for it to be specifically
                    in cybersecurity. Many professionals hold degrees in other fields, technical or not. While it is not
                    required, it is often advised that background in an IT field or computer science is helpful before
                    diving into a degree based around cybersecurity. Either route you go, a degree in cybersecurity will
                    allow you to open doors or more easily find yourself in leadership positions.</p>
                <p class="card-text">
                    The time and money required for a degree in most cases exceeds that which would go into a
                    certificate or certification, with an average of 2-4 years and around $60,000, but if you are
                    entering the field for the first time it may be your best bet. Around 82% of job postings about
                    cybersecurity require a bachelor's degree and 4% require a graduate degree, however only 2% of those
                    specify that it must be in cybersecurity. Keep that in mind in case you want to major in something
                    else while keeping your doors open to cybersecurity.

    <h4 class="text-center">Final Thoughts</h4>
    <p class="card-text mx-4">If you are still curious about entering cybersecurity, but aren't sure which path
        is best for you, take into account your own personal scenario. Think about how much experience you
        have in IT related fields. If you have little to no experience you may want to take certification
        courses and use that to open the door for an undergraduate degree, while those with more experience
        may lean towards getting more certifications under their belt or going for a graduate degree.</p>
    <p class="card-text mx-4">You also have to think about the amount of time it will take you. Not everybody has
        the time to take classes, it may be family or multiple jobs, but you can still use your free time to
        study for a certification and take the exam on a free day. If you are rolling in free time you could
        go for one of the higher education routes, keeping in mind for both the different costs of classes,
        books, and other study material you may need.</p>
    <p class="card-text mx-4">If you are doing all this for a specific job, or just to strengthen your own
        background, you need to account for which will have the greatest positive impact on your life once
        obtained. Certain employers will be more inclined to hire over a degree or a belt of certifications
        than a certificate, but if you are already secured in a job a certificate might be just what you
        need for that salary boost.</p>
